<p>Azure Migration uses Azure Site Recovery replication together with a variety of assessment tools to successfully duplicate server on-prem server configurations in Microsoft Azure. These are typically called “lift-and-shift” migrations.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/migrate/azure-migration-guide/?tabs=Overview">The Azure Migration Guide</a> is the principal resource in understanding how Azure Migration works. Specifically it provides a roadmap to important steps for any migration, including assessment, migration, optization and potential later workload transformation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>32- vs. 64-bit OS migration - Windows Server 2008 was the final version of Windows Server to be available in a 32-bit distribution.</li>
  <li>Features - Key OS features, like Storage Spaces, Clustering, network virtualization, etc. are either completely missing in Windows Server 2008 or have substantially reduced functionality.</li>
  <li>Management tools connectivity - remote admin tools are version sensitive. Typically downlevel client versions are required for remote management tool connectivity.</li>
</ul>
