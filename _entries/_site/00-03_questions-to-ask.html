<p>Even if an Azure environment is built out and ready to host migrated workloads, a variety of questions could delay individual server migrations. You can assess the readiness of moving a particular workload by how well you understand these questions.</p>

<p>It is always good to have questions to ask! So here are a few:</p>

<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Where is the workload running? (On-prem, colo, other cloud). Is there a budgetary need to move workloads out of this location, e.g., expiring lease? (Investigate timing if so.)</li>
  <li>What is the relationship with the workload owner(s)? Are they in the room for the discussion? Are they on board with putting their workload in the cloud?</li>
  <li>Are there other workloads similar to this which have already been migrated to Azure?</li>
  <li>Whatâ€™s the the regulatory environment around the customer/workload (FINRA, FedRamp, etc.) and how will it impact architecture/design for the environment?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="application">Application</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Is there an application inventory for all the servers considered for migration?</li>
  <li>Are there third-party applications loaded on the server(s)? Is the ISV still supporting it?</li>
  <li>Are the apps available in the Marketplace? Could the app(s) be restaged on a Azure native image?</li>
  <li>Lift and shift vs replatforming: Is there an option to move to a SaaS options for the app?</li>
  <li>WS: Can the app run on Windows 2012 or later? Or is it necessary to leave it on Windows Server 2008/R2?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="os">OS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Windows 2008 was offered as a 32-bit version. Are any migrations of 32-bit servers planned?</li>
  <li>How is the server being updated, e.g., Windows Update, SCCM, Ubuntu Advantage, etc. Is there a plan in place to extend this to the cloud or will updates move to Azure Update Management?</li>
  <li>How is the system being monitored e.g., via on on-prem agent (SCOM, SolarWinds, etc.). Will this be maintained on Azure?</li>
  <li>Do security/audit events roll up into a SIEM, i.e., Splunk, IBM Qradar, etc? Will this need to be maintained as is?</li>
  <li>Does this server require hands-on (console) access? Does the end-user customer expect to be able to access it via RDP/ssh?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Is there a migration window for the workload? How long is it?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="migration">Migration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What is the timing for migration? Is there a end-date that must be met?</li>
  <li>Are all of the people involved or affected migration aware of the process?</li>
</ul>
